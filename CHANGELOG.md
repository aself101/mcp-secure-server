# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This project uses manual versioning with the `-security` suffix during the initial release phase.

> **Note:** This package was previously developed under versions 0.7.x - 1.0.x but was blocked on npm due to namespace restrictions. GitHub Support unblocked the package and published 0.0.1-security as the initial release. All future versions will build from this baseline. For historical development context, see the [commit history](https://github.com/aself101/mcp-secure-server/commits/main).

## [0.0.5-security](https://github.com/aself101/mcp-secure-server/releases/tag/v0.0.5-security) (2026-01-22)

### Features

- **server:** add `capabilities` option for custom MCP server capabilities
- **security:** add security presets (`strict`, `standard`, `permissive`) for easier configuration
- **security:** add context-aware tool validation with security levels
- **config:** add config-driven tool policies for per-tool security rules
- **config:** add minimatch patterns for flexible path matching in policies
- **cookbook:** add `tool-policies-server` example with context-aware security levels
- **cookbook:** add `securityLevel` presets to all server examples

### Improvements

- Enhanced error logging with better context for debugging
- Improved test coverage across all security layers
- Enhanced configuration inheritance for nested options

## [0.0.1-security](https://github.com/aself101/mcp-secure-server/releases/tag/v0.0.1-security) (2026-01-02)

Initial npm release after namespace unblock.

### Features

- **5-Layer Security Pipeline** - Defense-in-depth validation architecture
  - Layer 1: Structure validation (JSON-RPC format, size limits, encoding)
  - Layer 2: Content validation (injection, XSS, path traversal, prototype pollution)
  - Layer 3: Behavior validation (rate limiting, burst detection, timing analysis)
  - Layer 4: Semantics validation (tool contracts, resource policies, quotas)
  - Layer 5: Contextual validation (custom validators, domain restrictions, OAuth)

- **SecureMcpServer** - Drop-in replacement for McpServer with built-in security
- **HTTP Transport** - `createSecureHttpServer()` and `createSecureHttpHandler()` for HTTP deployments
- **Configurable Options** - 20+ security parameters including `maxParamCount`, rate limits, quotas
- **Error Sanitization** - Prevents information leakage with credential redaction
- **TypeScript Support** - Full type definitions with strict mode, type guards included

### Security

- Comprehensive attack pattern detection (SQLi, XSS, command injection, SSRF, XXE, etc.)
- Context-aware sensitive file detection to prevent false positives
- Production-ready error handling with correlation IDs

### Documentation

- 11 cookbook examples demonstrating real-world usage patterns
- Complete API reference with TypeScript examples
- Claude Desktop integration guide
